# Spaceship Repair Simulator - Utah Indie Game Jam 2022

Spaceship Repair Simulator is a game that was made in 48 hours at the 2022 Utah Indie Game Jam.  The theme of the jam was "Reconnect".  This is a two-player / split screen game, where you race to grab parts to repair and endless line of ships.  Each part you find must be "reconnected" to the ship by "re-wiring" the part into the ship.  

But some parts are easier than others, are you up for the challenge?
